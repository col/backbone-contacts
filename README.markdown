backbone-contacts
-----------------

This is a simple application for me to try out Backbone.js. The contact list page loads contact records from a remote server and caches them using local storage.
Additional features such as searching, filtering and pagination will be added soon.

Note: This app uses rails scaffolding to achieve the CRUD actions. There are no plans on implementing this with Backbone.js at this stage.
