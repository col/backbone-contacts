backbone-contacts
-----------------

This is a simple application for me to try out Backbone.js. The contact list page loads contact records from the server as JSON and caches them on the client using local storage.
Additional features such as searching, filtering and pagination will be added soon.

Note: This app uses rails scaffolding to achieve the CRUD actions. There are no plans to implementing the CRUD actions via Backbone.js.
